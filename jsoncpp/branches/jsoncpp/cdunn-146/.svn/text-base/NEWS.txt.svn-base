  New in JsonCpp 0.6.0:
  ---------------------

* Compilation

  - LD_LIBRARY_PATH and LIBRARY_PATH environment variables are now propagated to the build
    environment as this is required for some compiler installation.

  - Added support for Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 (bug #2930462): 
    The platform "msvc90" has been added.

    Notes: you need to setup the environment by running vcvars32.bat 
    (e.g. MSVC 2008 command prompt in start menu) before running scons.
    
* Value

  - Removed experimental ValueAllocator, it caused static 
    initialization/destruction order issues (bug #2934500). 
    The DefaultValueAllocator has been inlined in code.
